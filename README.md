# Roll Table (rtbl)


A CLI to randomly select an entry from a table, a la TableSmith. This is _not_ a re-write of TS or a full impleemntation. This is a simple project that allows me to learn golang.

Currently it can read some simple sample tables and has a few, trivial, functions builtin.


Output is converted from hrml to text by default.

With thanks to the original [TableSmith](http://www.mythosa.net/p/tablesmith.html) author, Bruce Gulke for an excellent product.
